## Same program in many languages  

**This is just fun, nothing more.**  

Due to linguistic peculiarities, the structure of the programs is not
perfectly identical. Any operational differences (e.g. input method)
can be read in the footnote. For some programming languages, we have
tried to use the older dialect to convey the significant syntactic
differences between the languages. Modern languages​have become a little
closer to each other.

_If you feel like it, you can join this poor geek fun, submit your
program written in several different languages ​and we will publish it._
In the program header, please include the following information:
purpose, author, license, language (dialect), testing environment, and
the same information about the original file.

      line parameters, so it prompts for the data.
